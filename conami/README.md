This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

If you do not have pnpm installed
npm install -g pnpm 


First, run the development server: 
pnpm run dev 
inside the conami folder **** NOT your computer root directory

If this doesnt work you must do pnpm install 


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
